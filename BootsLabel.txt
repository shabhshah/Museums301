The most essential piece of gear for backcountry adventures, boots have been around for centuries. These specific boots, made by Asolo of Italy, are the TPS 520. Made of a full grain leather upper, they also have a Gore-Tex lining, making them waterproof and breathable. These boots can be used in all seasons and can have certain crampons attached to them. Purchased in April of 2017, these boots have already seen heavy use in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and the Garwhal Himalayas in Uttarakhand, India. These boots have broken in nicely and provide long lasting support and comfort to the wearer.
